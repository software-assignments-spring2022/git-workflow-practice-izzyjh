## Article:
 [The Future of Software Development in 2022 and Beyond](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/403829).

## Thoughts:

The article is discussing the new key trends of Software Development whilst also saying that we need to be prepared for the unexpected because the future is always uncertain. One key trend is that remote and hybrid work has increased significantly due to the pandemic and will most likely be permanent in many cases. Another key trend is the utilization of AI. This will not only be happening more for new technologies, but it will also be integrated into many existing technologies. All in all, the author, Steve Taplin, emphasizes the importance of Software development firms to take the extra time and effort to keep up with emerging trends and look for unexpected outcomes. This will give these companies an advantage.

It was really interesting to read about the predicted and currently emerging trends for software development in 2022. I agree with Taplin that it is important to be caught up with emerging trends and to be prepared for an unexpected future in order be successful in software development. 

## Comment from Yousuf Kidwai:

I think this article is really interesting. I wonder if the integration of artificial intelligence into many existing technologies will also lead to artificial intelligence being able to code better than human software developers. Also, I do think that the hybrid model will become a new norm in today's working society, especially for companies that found that they were able to produce better when their employees were working remote.

## Comment from Hannah Harvard
I think the part about working remotely intrigues me a lot. I'm unsure about whether or not I favor it but I have seen a lot of companies promote and become much more open to it. I wonder if it will continue after the pandemic ends... whenever that does happen.
