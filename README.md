## Article:
 [The Future of Software Development in 2022 and Beyond](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/403829).

## Thoughts:

The article is discussing the new key trends of Software Development whilst also saying that we need to be prepared for the unexpected because the future is always uncertain. One key trend is that remote and hybrid work has increased significantly due to the pandemic and will most likely be permanent in many cases. Another key trend is the utilization of AI. This will not only be happening more for new technologies, but it will also be integrated into many existing technologies. All in all, the author, Steve Taplin, emphasizes the importance of Software development firms to take the extra time and effort to keep up with emerging trends and look for unexpected outcomes. This will give these companies an advantage.

It was really interesting to read about the predicted and currently emerging trends for software development in 2022. I agree with Taplin that it is important to be caught up with emerging trends and to be prepared for an unexpected future in order be successful in software development. 

## Comments:

I find it really intersting to see how important AI has become in recent years and just how increasingly relevant it will continue to be. There are so many areas of computer science that can be made more intelligent by machine learning. This article lists cloud technologies as one example, but automation has a place almost everywhere.
